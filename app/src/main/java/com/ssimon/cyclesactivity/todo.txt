Change get coffees code so doesn't reset default volume id if not set.
Implement Coffee cache
Add methods to access db off main thread.
Finish onClickSaveCycles.
Test for CyclesActivity:
    set parm buttons, get parm buttons, compare values
Where put button to delete volume?
Tie together MAX_NUM_CYCLES and cycle table layout
    Create table programmatically?
Tie together references to columns in XML and in code
    Use resource IDs?
Special case last vacuum mintime
Can coalesce BREWTIME and VACUUMTIME since same range and resolution.
Implement total volume.
Make lists of volumes and cycles unmodifiable.
Create separate getTestInstance() for DatabaseHelper, which creates db with different name from
    non-test (so won't overwrite).
Need to make lists inside Coffee, Volume classes unmodifiable.

CyclesActivity layouts
    Reduce sizes to improve spacing and grouping
        (so views with related functionality are visually grouped together)
    Increase size of +, - buttons
    Can +, - buttons and seekbar all be the same color (since functionality is related)?
    Revert widths for cycle parameter column sizes to explicit
        widths and margins, in place of the current 0dp/weight=1 width specifications


DONE
Use Checker in CyclesActivity, etc.
Implement default volume id.
Implement test that uses loops to create large numbers of coffee, with large numbers
    of volume, with large numbers of cycles.
Remove volumeID field from Cycle
Fix name()
Test cascading deletes
Improve save/retrieve test to check ids.
Improve test code organization.
