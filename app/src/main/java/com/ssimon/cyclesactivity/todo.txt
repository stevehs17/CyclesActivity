Use ROW_ID for cycles instead of index.
Might also want to sort by ROW_ID for volumes for testing purpose
    - So can compare what's created with what's read.
Add stress tests for db code
    I.e.: have large numbers of coffees -- 30 and 10*30
Change MIN/MAX_BREW/VACUUMTIME to MIN/MAX_TIME
Figure out better way to organize code in DbaseUtils
    Move default coffee code to elsewhere
    Then can change name to DaoUtils
"Manage Coffees" -> "Coffees", etc.
"Edit Coffee" -> "Edit", etc.
Proceed with implementation
Make lists single choice mode.
General strategy for managing Coffee data:
    All three manage activities get coffee list from cache in onStart().
        In onStart(), they register event bus and then post refresh event.
Make refresh coffee event non-sticky if, in fact, it's not needed since refresh coffee event is always sent in onPause().
Improve rigor of deleteCoffees() -- use transactions, validate parameters.
Change get coffees code so doesn't reset default volume id if not set. (?)
Add methods to access db off main thread.
Finish onClickSaveCycles.
Test for CyclesActivity:
    set parm buttons, get parm buttons, compare values
Where put button to delete volume?
Tie together MAX_NUM_CYCLES and cycle table layout
    Create table programmatically?
Tie together references to columns in XML and in code
    Use resource IDs?
Special case last vacuum mintime
Can coalesce BREWTIME and VACUUMTIME since same range and resolution.
Implement total volume.
Create separate getTestInstance() for DatabaseHelper, which creates db with different name from
    non-test (so won't overwrite).
Figure out how user should specify default volume.
    In ManageCoffees or ManageVolumes?
Add findViewByIdOrThrow().
Add Checker methods where can add a name (for cases where there are multiple parameters
    that use the same Checker method).
Fix access of methods used by test code
    Some are public just for test code; see if that can be fixed.
CyclesActivity layouts
    Reduce sizes to improve spacing and grouping
        (so views with related functionality are visually grouped together)
    Increase size of +, - buttons
    Can +, - buttons and seekbar all be the same color (since functionality is related)?
    Revert widths for cycle parameter column sizes to explicit
        widths and margins, in place of the current 0dp/weight=1 width specifications
Add icons to improve appearance of list items
Clean up test code
Improve Espresso test that navigates edit hierarchy
    Set database and Validate specific activities
Add methods: getIntentExtraOrThrow*
Make sure event callbacks in one activity aren't getting called in virtue of message being
    sent from another.
Rather than storing default volume id with Coffee, maybe should store it with BrewActivity?
    Use separate table from Coffee?
        That table will have a single column, Vol Id, and Coffee Id will be a foreign key.
            For cache: can use Map from Cof Id to Vol Id
     Then: remove default vol id from Coffee class!



DONE
Use Checker in CyclesActivity, etc.
Implement default volume id.
Implement test that uses loops to create large numbers of coffee, with large numbers
    of volume, with large numbers of cycles.
Remove volumeID field from Cycle
Fix name()
Test cascading deletes
Improve save/retrieve test to check ids.
Improve test code organization.
Implement Coffee cache
Make lists of volumes and cycles unmodifiable.
Provide default recipe.
Fix espresso test.
Implement selection of coffee, volume, working.
Try updating gradle and running tests in separate processes
Refactor db tests based on GC2 design

Rewrite data tests
Populate db for espresso test.

Fix Coffee constructors
    Should just sort volumes once; this may require allowing UNSET_DB_ID as a legal
    parameter vaue.
Add LeakCanary.

When create database, provide some default recipes.
    To add, can call methods in CoffeeDao.
