Test for cycleActivity:
    set parm buttons, get parm buttons, compare values
Where put button to delete volume?
Tie together MAX_NUM_CYCLES and cycle table layout
    Create table programmatically?
Tie together references to columns in XML and in code
    Use resource IDs?
CyclesActivity layouts
    Reduce sizes to improve spacing and grouping
        (so views with related functionality are visually grouped together)
    Increase size of +, - buttons
    Can +, - buttons and seekbar all be the same color (since functionality is related)?
    Revert widths for cycle parameter column sizes to explicit
        widths and margins, in place of the current 0dp/weight=1 width specifications


DONE
Use Checker in CyclesActivity, etc.
